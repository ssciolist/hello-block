# Contributing

This is a personal project, and I appreciate any contributions, so thank you for your time!

Please follow the Getting Started guide in the ReadMe to set up your local dev environment.

## Reporting a bug
Before reporting a bug, please check if it has [already been reported](https://github.com/ssciolist/hello-block/issues). If it hasn't and you want to file a new bug report, provide the following information:

* Where/on which page did the error happen?
* How can the error be reproduced?
* What was the expected and what the actual behaviour?
* Can you provide an error message or a screenshot that illustrates the problem?

## Proposing a feature

Since it's just me for the moment, I'd love to talk through about potential features either in person or in a video chat. Email me at arellano.megan@gmail.com or reach out here to get started. 

## Submitting a Pull Request
Use the GitHub UI to submit a new pull request against upstream/master. To increase the chances that your pull request is swiftly accepted please

* Write tests
* Keep your PR small, with a single focus
* Use a style consistent with the rest of the codebase
* Before submitting, rebase your work on the current master branch

In this project, making a pull request is a just way to start a conversation about a piece of code. I hope to learn more about Rails and Javascript from the development community.
